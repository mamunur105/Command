After install Xampp/lampp 

Install composer like so:

`sudo curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | /opt/lampp/bin/php`

After installation, you should then symlink it by running command:

`sudo ln -s /opt/lampp/bin/php /usr/local/bin/php`
Then run the command below to allow the 'composer' command to be run globally (this will be run from within the folder where you've just installed composer in which a composer.phar file has just been created):

`sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer`
